# Scores

The scores logic is written in JSON, this way it is made easy for scores to be added, changed, removed and written.

## Json structure
```json
[
  {
    "scores": {
      "score-robot-ui": 0,
      "score-robot-technical": 0,
      "score-back-end": 0,
      "score-front-end": 0,
      "score-ict-ondernemer": 0
    }
  }
]
```
