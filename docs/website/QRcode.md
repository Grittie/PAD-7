# Website QR code

[â—„ back to index](../index.md)

To show the QR code to the study chooser we are using the [website](../website/website.md).

We added a container containing a link to the current QR code generated by the Python code.
### HTML
```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="section" id="QR-code">
        <img src="../QRcode/QRcodes/QRs/testcode_1.png" alt="QR Code">
    </div>
    <br><br>
</div>
```

This QR code gets deleted after 30 seconds, we make sure using javascript that the website gets refreshed to show if a QR code is actually there.

### Javascript
```javascript
// Set timeout function
setTimeout(function(){
    // Query selector that adds randomizes no cache to image to prevent the website from loading the cache
    document.querySelector("img").src += "?nocache=" + Math.random();
    window.location.reload(1);
}, 5000);
```

We use a window reload to show if there is an image or not. Also important to note we add a "?nocache=" value to the image to make sure the website doesn't get stuck using the cached image instead of loading the new QR.
